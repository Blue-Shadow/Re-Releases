setslot 1 NewFist Pitchfork // you can't imagine how much that pitchfork on 2nd slot pissed me off
setslot 2 RevolverBlood // a peashooter must be on 2nd slot, and 1st slot is for melee weapons!
setslot 3 Sawedoff_ // thus the shotgun takes traditional 3rd place
setslot 4 Thompson_ // and the Tommy-gun - the 4th
setslot 5 NapalmLauncher_ // guess where I put the rocket launcher?
setslot 6 // better clear these slots so original Doom guns won't be selected even if someone uses cheats
